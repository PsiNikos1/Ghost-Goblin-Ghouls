!All algorithms are implemeted from sk-learn

Knn is implemented with Euclidean Distance. Accuracy score was 70% with K=70.
The neural network is implemented with gradient descent, mean squared error with 200 epoch and trained in every "monster" its classifies. Accuracy  score was 70%.
The SVM is implemented with 2 differents kernels, linear & RBF , with the one-vs-all strategy. The accuracy score is 66% for linear kernel and 72% for RBF kernel.
Last, the Naive Bayes is implemented with accuracy score of 77%.

All the accuracy scores are measured through the site of kaggle.
